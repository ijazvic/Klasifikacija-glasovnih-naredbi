This project focuses on building a system for **classifying simple voice commands** using deep learning.  
A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** was trained on a speech commands dataset to recognize words such as *up, down, left, right, on, off, yes, no, go, stop*.  

The project includes:
- Preprocessing of audio signals (spectrograms, MFCCs)  
- Training and evaluation of the CNN model  
- A simple **Streamlit app** for recording and classifying commands in real time
